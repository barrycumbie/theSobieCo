    <h2>The SOBIE Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>SOBIE</b> mission is to encourage business faculty members to respond to current economic and market issues, and find practical solutions to the many problems business people and public policymakers confront.<br><br>
      <b>SOBIE</b> invites business and economic research, as well as interdisciplinary research. Research is essential to the continuity and pursuit of knowledge. The seeds for economic growth, market innovation, more effective business practices, consumer trends, and greater profits often come from the ideas we germinate through our research.<br><br>
      <b>SOBIE</b> was founded on the idea that peer-reviewed research at small colleges and regional universities was viable and needed to be recognized. Faculty, non-academic professionals, business people, doctoral candidates, graduate students, and undergraduate students are invited to participate.
